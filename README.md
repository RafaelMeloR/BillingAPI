# BillingAPI

REST API, powered by ASP.NET Core, seamlessly integrates with a ReactJS front-end. It facilitates essential operations such as user authentication, invoice generation, payment processing, and user creation. The corresponding SQL database is optimized with necessary tables and stored procedures to ensure project functionality.

The entire solution is deployed on Azure, emphasizing scalability and reliability. Both the API and the database are hosted on Azure for a streamlined and secure billing system.
